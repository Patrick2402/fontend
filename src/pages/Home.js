              <div className="poem">
  <p>With SQL as my sword, and JS by my side,</p>
  <p>I vanquish the bugs and make code collide.</p>
  <p>My queries are sharp, my functions are tight,</p>
  <p>Performance improved, all through the night.</p>
</div>
<div className="poem">
  <p>With every join and index I create,</p>
  <p>The data flows smoothly, never late.</p>
  <p>My skills in these languages, I hone and refine,</p>
  <p>Making our systems, a thing of design.</p>

<div className="poem">
  <p>A coder of glory, a won in the game,</p>
  <p>With every challenge, I rise to fame.</p>
  <p>My passion and knowledge, a force to be reckoned,</p>
  <p>With SQL and JS, my code is second to none.</p>
</div>
<div className="poem">
  <p>So let it be known, my greatness and skill,</p>
  <p>In the world of coding, I am a thrill.</p>
